# Adventure-Mode
Turn-Based C# RPG 


This is a game that I have been developing;

# Explore the 16 lands of this strange world!
# Wield powerful weapons and awesome magics to battle a myriad of strange foes!
# Seek out mystical treasures and enchanted armors to survive a hostile world!
# Learn obscure magics and gain the powers of the cosmic spheres!

This program uses the code-first entity framework approach to establish databases of procedural foes, items, and magics.
The game utilizes many core software development concepts in the object-oriented programming paradigm; this program is both a work of passion and an exploration into further understanding of programming.
